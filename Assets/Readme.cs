//Lighting model used 
//Team Fortress 2 toony shader lighting model with ramp map for toon shading
//Number of shaders created for Assignment 2 Holographic and Dissolve
//Number of scripts created : 3 : Autorotation for rotating the objects, AutoDissolve for Dissolving and Un dissolving the textures,
//								   Light movement for movement of light
//Inspiration Drawn from : 1) 1:32 to 1:34 of the video where the soldier vanishes http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FPtT4C870c
//						   2) 3:17 TO 3:20 where James bond is introduced to Aston Martin " Vanish"   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uZRYO8BcL4
//						   3) X-Ray Shaders
//						   4) Holographic shaders
//						   5) Dissolve shaders
//Aim : Tried to create shaders that can recreate holographic ,XRay and Dissolve shader effects which are similar to those seen on the unity store
//and can be used to recreate those effects as seen in the videos
//
//
//Comment : Had fun working with shaders
